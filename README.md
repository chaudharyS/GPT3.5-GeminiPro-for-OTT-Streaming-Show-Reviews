## Abstract
There has been a significant rise in the number of users on streaming platforms in the last few years. More and more people consume content on these platforms now. Thus, it becomes imperative to analyze audience and critic reviews of shows on these platforms. This study aims to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analyzing audience and critic reviews of online streaming shows. The research focuses on two key tasks: sentiment analysis of critic reviews and rating prediction based on audience reviews. Additionally, it investigates the impact of few-shot learning on these tasks. This research contributes to our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in sentiment analysis and rating prediction within the context of streaming media reviews, offering insights for both academic research and industry applications in content evaluation and recommendation systems.
